# Connect: Your Personal Static Link-in-Bio Website

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

Connect is a fully responsive, open-source, and static link-sharing website built with **Next.js**. It's the perfect solution for creating a "link-in-bio" page for your social media profiles, a simple portfolio, or a single page to share all your important links. Because it's a static site, it's incredibly fast, secure, and easy to deploy.
